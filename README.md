The Air Pollution Monitoring System is a pioneering initiative designed to combat the growing problem of air pollution. This system employs gas sensors connected to Arduino microcontrollers to detect and measure pollutants like carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and other harmful gases in real-time. By doing so, it provides a cost-effective and efficient solution for monitoring air quality, making it a valuable tool for environmentalists, researchers, and policymakers in their efforts to address the pressing issue of air pollution.
